# SAFARI demo | Computer Vision at the Edge
The goal of this series is to make use of the power and versatility of [Red Hat速 OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) for the preparation and deployment of computer vision applications at the edge. In environments where resources are limited, [Single Node OpenShift速](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/meet-single-node-openshift-our-smallest-openshift-footprint-edge-architectures) (SNO) can be used as a data center for model processing and training. It can run on both cloud and bare metal nodes. On such nodes we will deploy [Red Hat速 OpenShift速 AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai) and the necessary components to enable GPU hardware and accelerate our model training. OpenShift AI gives us the possibility to use Notebooks where we will import our YOLO algorithm and the necessary dataset for training. Finally, with OpenShift Virtualization, we will simulate a device at the edge. There, we are going to install MicroShift and deploy our Safari application on top of it. This app will be able to detect animals in real time and give us information about them.
