# Safari model weights
If you want to play with the Safary application, but you don't have time to train the model, here you can get the [model weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lHrDnfiFHxEe00CObHmBvc2Vg_6FdL0s?usp=sharing) file. Upload the `best.pt` file to your Jupyter environment in Red Hat OpenShift AI and remember to modify the code to point to your file path.
